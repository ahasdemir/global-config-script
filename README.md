# Minecraft Options Synchronization System

This system provides intelligent synchronization of Minecraft settings across different instances in PrismLauncher.

## üìã Overview

The system consists of three main files that work together to manage Minecraft configurations:
- **Startup Script**: Loads saved settings when Minecraft starts.
- **Exit Script**: Saves current settings when Minecraft closes
- **Merge Script**: Intelligently combines settings without overwriting existing configurations

## üìÅ Files

### Core Scripts
- `options-changer-startup.bat` - Pre-launch configuration loader
- `options-changer-exit.bat` - Post-game configuration saver
- `merge-options.ps1` - PowerShell script for intelligent options merging

### Configuration Files
- `options.txt` - Minecraft settings (graphics, controls, gameplay)
- `servers.dat` - Server list (binary format)

## üöÄ How It Works

### Startup Process
1. **Pre-Launch**: `options-changer-startup.bat` runs before Minecraft starts
2. **Smart Merge**: Uses PowerShell script to merge saved settings with existing ones
3. **Preservation**: Keeps existing custom settings while updating changed/new ones
4. **Fallback**: If merge fails, falls back to simple copy operation

### Exit Process
1. **Post-Game**: `options-changer-exit.bat` runs after Minecraft closes
2. **Intelligent Update**: Only saves changed or new settings to central location
3. **Server Sync**: Copies server list normally (binary file)

## üî® Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows with PowerShell support
- PrismLauncher with custom commands enabled

### Setup
1. Place all files in: `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\global-config-script\`
2. (Optional, but recommended) 
   - Replace the `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\global-config-script\options.txt` file with the backup from `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\global-config-script\backup-original-for-avoid-corruptions\options.txt`.
3. Configure PrismLauncher custom command settings:
   - **Pre-launch command**: `"C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\global-config-script\options-changer-startup.bat"`
   - **Post-exit command**: `"C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\global-config-script\options-changer-exit.bat"`
   - It should be like that:

### Environment Variables
The scripts use `%INST_MC_DIR%` which is automatically provided by PrismLauncher pointing to the current instance directory.

## üîß Features

### Smart Options Merging
- ‚úÖ **Preserves existing settings** - Your custom configurations stay intact
- ‚úÖ **Updates changed values** - Modified settings are synchronized
- ‚úÖ **Adds new settings** - New options from mods/updates are included
- ‚úÖ **Excludes protected settings** - Certain settings are never transferred
- ‚úÖ **Alphabetical sorting** - Keeps options.txt organized
- ‚úÖ **Detailed logging** - Shows what was added/updated/excluded during merge

### Server List Handling
- ‚úÖ **Direct copy** - `servers.dat` is copied as-is (binary format)
- ‚úÖ **Full synchronization** - Complete server list is maintained

### Error Handling
- ‚úÖ **Fallback mechanism** - If PowerShell merge fails, uses simple copy
- ‚úÖ **Path validation** - Checks if source and destination paths exist
- ‚úÖ **Error reporting** - Clear messages for troubleshooting

## üìä Merge Logic

### When merging `options.txt`:
```
Existing Setting + Same Value = No Change
Existing Setting + New Value = Update
Missing Setting + New Value = Add
Old Setting + Not in New = Keep
Excluded Setting = Never Transfer
```

### Protected Settings
The following settings are **never transferred** between instances:
- `resourcePacks` - Resource pack list (allows different packs per instance)
- `incompatibleResourcePacks` - Incompatible resource pack list

### Example Merge Output:
```
Excluded: resourcePacks (not transferred)
Excluded: incompatibleResourcePacks (not transferred)
Added: newModSetting = true
Updated: fov = 0.45
Updated: renderDistance = 16
Merge completed successfully!
Added 1 new settings, updated 2 existing settings, excluded 2 settings
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### Multi-Instance Gaming
- Play different modpacks with consistent settings
- Switch between Minecraft versions seamlessly
- Maintain personalized controls across all instances
- **Use different resource packs** - Each instance keeps its own resource pack list

### Settings Backup
- Automatic backup of all configuration changes
- Central storage for easy restoration
- Version-safe settings management
- **Protected settings** - Critical instance-specific settings are preserved

### Mod Compatibility
- Handles new mod settings automatically
- Preserves existing mod configurations
- Smart integration of updated mod options
- **Instance-specific exclusions** - Certain mod settings stay per-instance

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### PowerShell Execution Policy
If you get execution policy errors:
```batch
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File merge-options.ps1
```

#### Script Not Found
Ensure paths in batch files match your actual file locations:
```batch
set "DEST_DIR=C:\Users\[your-username]\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\global-config-script\"
```

#### Merge Failures
The system automatically falls back to simple copy if merge fails, so your settings are never lost.

### Debug Information
Check console output for detailed information about:
- Which settings were added/updated
- File operation results
- Error messages and fallback actions

### Current Version
- ‚úÖ Intelligent options.txt merging
- ‚úÖ PowerShell-based merge logic
- ‚úÖ Fallback to simple copy
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging
- ‚úÖ Error handling

### Previous Version
- Basic file copying
- No merge intelligence
- Overwrote all settings

## üìû Support

For issues or improvements:
1. Check console output for error messages
2. Verify file paths and permissions
3. Test with simple copy fallback
4. Check PowerShell execution policy
